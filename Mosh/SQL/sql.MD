# SQL Course

---

## Getting Started

> A **database** is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed.

We use a database management system **DBMS** to manage , querying and modifying data. The DBMS will execute our instruction and send result back.

We have 2 categories of DBMS:

- Relation
- Nosql (non relation)

Sql: Structured Query Language.

NoSql : doesn't understand sql.
