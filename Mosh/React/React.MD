# React Course

## Chapter 1 : Getting started

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces.

> Components are essentially a piece of the UI.

The building process is about merging the multiple components to create a complexe Interface.

Every react application has a route component. It represent the entire application with other child component. So every application is a tree of component.

Every component is build like a javascript class.

```javascript
class tweet {
  state = {};
  render() {
    // react element
  }
}
```

THe react element is mapping the dom element. React keep a lightweight representation of the dom in memory. We no longer need to work with the dom api.

React reacts to state of changes.

> Angular vs React: They have similar components. But Angular is a framework for complete solution and React is a library. And react only take care of rendering the vue and making the vue is in sink with the state. That's why it has very small api to learn. When buildidng an application with react, we need to use other libraries for routing, calling http services and so on.

### Setup

- install nodejs
- [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- `npm i -g create-react-app` // @tospecifyaversion
- Vscode extension: simple React snippet and Prettier code formatter (editor format on save = true).

### First react app

Let's create our first react app.

```bash
# For installation
# $ create-react-app <project path>
$ create-react-app React/react-app

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts...

Success! Created react-app at /Users/alexandrodisla/Desktop/repo/formation/Mosh/React/React/react-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd /Users/alexandrodisla/Desktop/repo/formation/Mosh/React/React/react-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
